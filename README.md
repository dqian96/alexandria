# Alexandria

Alexandria is an in-memory, distributed key-value store written in Go.

It is designed to be a fast, eventually consistent, and highly available cache, making it ideal for storing non-mission critical data in order to alleviate database load.

Alexandria is strongly influenced by Redis and Memcached.
